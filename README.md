# d3-challenge

The D3_data_journalism folder contains a html file that uses Javascript D3 (app.js) to render a scatter plot that shows the percent of poverty vs. the lack of healthcare in each state.  Each point is labeled with the state abbreviation.

The bonus folder contains a similiar plot that has multiple axis options.  Both the x and y axes have 3 possible data sets that can be chosen by clicking on the axis title.  The axis scale and scatter points will smoothly transition to show the new dataset.  Tooltips are also utilized for this plot, hover over any point to see the data for that point.
